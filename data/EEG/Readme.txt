Description: This is a dataset of EEG recordings. The training data is organized into ten minute EEG clips labeled "Preictal" for pre-seizure data segments, or "Interictal" for non-seizure data segments. There are 2406 records each of which is a variable-length time-series of 16 attributes. We featurize this dataset into records of 32 attributesâ€“ the mean and variance over the length of the time-series. 

Error: This dataset primarily contains numerical outliers.

ML task: Classification: predict Eye state
